## Overview  
The **Task Manager** app is designed to help users organize their tasks with a simple interface. Users can create tasks, delete them, and assign priority levels ranging from 1 to 3. Each priority level is color-coded for easy identification:  
- **Priority 1** (High) – Red  
- **Priority 2** (Medium) – Yellow  
- **Priority 3** (Low) – Green  

## Features  
- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks with a title and description.  
- **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be removed from the list.  
- **Priority Levels**: Tasks can be assigned a priority of 1, 2, or 3, each with a distinct color.  
- **Simple UI**: A clean and intuitive user interface to manage tasks easily.  
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored locally so that they persist even after the app is closed.

## Technologies Used  
- **Kotlin**: Programming language used for the app’s logic.  
- **Android Studio**: IDE used for developing the app.  
- **SQLite/Room**: Local database used for storing tasks.  
- **XML**: Used for designing the app's layout.  
- **RecyclerView**: For displaying tasks in a scrollable list.## Overview
